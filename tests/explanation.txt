1) Run the client:
python3 client.py 127.0.0.1 12345

2) Run all three servers (must be with the specified ports and IP addresses)
a. python3 server.py 5000 zone1.txt
b. python3 server.py 5001 zone2.txt
c. python3 server.py 5002 zone3.txt

3) Run the resolver in debugging mode (Press F5 in Visual Studio Code). Use the launch.json I provided
It will be easier to find out whether or not data is taken from cache properly if needed 

4) Some things that might want testing:
a. query: domainnotexist.subdomain.example.com and then ensure that the domain doesn't exist and that .subdomain.example.com, .example.com are properly cached.
b. query: www.subdomain.example.com (before the previous cache expires) and ensure that it immediately requests server3
c. query: goddamn.xxx.example.com and ensure it starts from server1, to server2 and finally obtains from server3
d. query: xxx.example.com (before the previous cache expires) and ensure that it immediately goes to server2
e. query: biu.ac.il and ensure that it takes it from server1 and that the ".il,127.0.0.1:5001,NS" mapping isn't used and isn't cached
f. query: domainnotexist.ac.il and ensure it returns that the domain doesn't exist and that .il is properly cached
g. query: yaani.co.il (before the previous cache expires) and ensure that it obtains .il from the cache so that server2 is queried immediately
